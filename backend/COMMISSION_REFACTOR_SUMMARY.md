## 🔧 Migration Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run the migration script
node scripts/migrateToCommissionFlow.js
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
node server.js

# Frontend (update API calls)
cd frontend  
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Updates Needed
The frontend will need updates to:
- Change `/api/freelancers` calls to `/api/artists`
- Replace messaging system with commission requests
- Update role checks from 'freelancer' to 'artist'

---

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

- `commission_requests`: Simple commission workflow

### Removed Tables

- `messages`: Replaced by commission progress updates
- `freelancers`: Renamed to artists

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update frontend to use new API endpoints
2. **Testing**: Test commission flow end-to-end
3. **Documentation**: Update API documentation if needed
4. **Migration**: Run migration script on production when ready

## 🔒 Security & Performance

- All commission endpoints require authentication
